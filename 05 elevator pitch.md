# Elevator Pitch 
For each interview you should have a 3-5-minute speech that highlights who you are, why you are in the market looking for a job, and why you’re qualified for the position you’re applying to. At some point in time, you may have more than one speech and that is normal. You may have one for different positions because each position has their own job description. Below is an example used by previous students. Please tailor it to fit you and your needs. Please keep in mind, this is just a start, it’s just an example. Feel free to add more or take away. 

## Examples 
### Who am I? 
My name is Black Panther, I have a bachelor’s degree in sociology/criminal justice. I started my Cybersecurity career 2019 with O-Line Security as a System Administrator. It was a great experience from managing risks, to identifying security gaps, and implementing security controls. Outside of that, I read, researched, and took extra classes on Udemy on my spare time. The more time I invested into my career the more I began to grow as a security professional. 

### Why you are qualified? 
I believe I am more than qualified for this position because of my experience, my passion for the field, and my proactiveness to go above and beyond. Throughout my career I have acquired a skillset that will make me an asset for your organization. For example, identifying and managing risks, conducting vulnerability scans, securing security gaps, and monitoring logs to ensure system availability. In addition, I am also Security+ certified and I am currently working on my CASP+. My goal now is to continue to grow by applying and enhancing my skillsets within a new environment.
